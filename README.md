## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I didn't use any outside resources.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Fortunately, I didn't encounter a challenge as I was following the instruction. I made sure to incrementally add pieces of code and refreshed to see their effect. I also experimented with my own variations of certain features. Lastly, I used console.log to debug.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing my submission, I am curious about the following, in regards to web development. What are the steps for troubleshooting if certain implemented features don't show up on the webpage? How can I make my webpage compatible for mobile browsers? How can I incorporate features that make a webpage more accessible for people with disabilities?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add additional features. One example would be allowing users to use key strokes to click on the buttons instead of requiring a mouse to click.
